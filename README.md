# Welcome to P1 Problem Set!

## Description
A simple central access page that provides my background information
and links to my future projects. Each future project has a link to
its live site and github repository. As background, the site shares
insight into who I am and what I do, offers perspective on why I'm
taking this course and what I hope to achieve, shares my prior 
experience with programming, and includes my desired programming
platform details. 

## Demo
Not required for P1

## Details for teaching team
No login required.

I started playing around with Bootstrap and then got side-tracked. So
I really just wanted to focus on getting the basics down on this project,
and making sure I thoroughly understand how to sequence the workflow, and 
get my live server up and running.

## Outside code
No outside code was used. I included some inherent css within the index.php
file to clean up the html presentation and provide some colorful line breaks
to improve readability.
