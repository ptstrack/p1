			<h2>Who I am and what I do</h2>
			<p>
				Hello - I work in business development and solutions design for a small non-profit healthcare 
				research and consulting company called the <a href="http://www.altarum.org">Altarum Institute
				</a>that focuses on improving human health. Recently, I've taken a more active role in improving 
				our online marketing presence, which means I need to learn more about developing dynamic websites
				and PHP, while also refreshing my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.
				<br>
				<br>
				For fun, I love spending time with my family and friends. I enjoy working out (especially CrossFit), 
				boating, snowboarding, and exploring new restaurants and events in the Washington, D.C. metro area."
			</p>
			
			<h2>Why I'm taking this course</h2>
			<p>
				I'm taking this course for several reasons. First, I've always wanted to know the 
				underlying technology behind how web applications work and how they're designed to 
				function. Second, I seem to encounter daily technology challenges with my own company's 
				software and I'm looking to help bridge the gap between the business end-user - <em>me</em> -  
				and our IT department. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, I find learning new concepts
				and applications to be extremely fun and rewarding. While the grades are important, I really
				just want to learn how this stuff works so I can have the requisite skills to play around 
				with it, try new features, and have fun!
			</p>
			
			<h2>Prior experience with programming</h2>
			<p>
				My previous experience with programming is a bit limited.  I took CSCI e12 in 2013 which
				was a great introduction into html, css, and js.  Prior to that, I last took some Pascal in
				high school and class in C++ about 20 years ago.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Which platform am I using?</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a diehard Apple fan - so even though I use a Dell for work, I use a Mac for all
				programming activities and coursework.
