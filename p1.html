			<h2>Who I am and what I do</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a management consultant who works for a healthcare systems research non-profit.
				I'm primarily focused on developing new business and identifying new innovations, and ways
				to apply to our clients
			</p>
			<h2>Why I'm taking this course</h2>
			<p>
				I'm taking this course for several reasons. First, I've always wanted to know the 
				underlying technology behind how web applications work and how they're designed to 
				function. Second, I constantly run into technology challenges with my own company's 
				software and I'm looking to help bridge the gap between the business end-user, me, 
				and our IT department.
			</p>
			<h2>Prior experience with programming</h2>
			<p>
				My previous experience with programming is a bit limited.  I took CSCI e12 in 2013 which
				was a great introduction into html, css, and js.  Prior to that, I last took some Pascal in
				high school and class in C++ about 20 years ago.
			</p>
			<h2>Which platform am I using?</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a diehard Apple fan - so even though I use a Dell for work, I use a Mac for all
				programming activities and coursework.
